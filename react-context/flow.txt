User can sign up
1. When a user clicks the 'Register now' or 'Sign Up' button(client/navbar.jsx),
   the page moves to the #sign-up page(client/auth-form.jsx, client/redirect.jsx).
2. It stays on the same #sign-up page even after refreshing the page.
   because window.location is set up to #sign-up (client/redirect.jsx, client/app.jsx).
3. When the user types Username and Password and press 'Register' button(client/auth-form.jsx),
   the input values get saved by the app.post('/api/auth/sign-up') in server/index.js.
4. Those sign up input values are store in the database
   containing username, hashedPassword, userId and creeatedAt (database/schema.sql)

User can sign in
1. When user input username and password values, those values will direct to
   app.post('api/auth/sign-in') in server/index.js and look for matching
   data in database/data.sql to check if they are valid.
2. If input values are not valid, user will get 401 status and 'invalid login' message.
3. If input values are valid and password matches the hashedPassword in database/data.sql,
   user will direct to the # page where it shows the GIFs.


User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page)
1. When user presses refresh button, user will stay signed in and stay in
   the same page because window.location is set up to # (client/redirect.jsx, client/app.jsx)

User can sign out
1. When user presses sign out button, user will be directed to #sign-in page(client/navbar.jsx)
